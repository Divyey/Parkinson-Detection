# Parkinson's Disease Detection
The purpose of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the presence of Parkinson's disease in an individual based on their voice recordings. Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement, with symptoms that include tremors, stiffness, and difficulty with coordination.
